# Decision-Tree-Regression-Age-prediction-of-Abalone
A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a “test” on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).
Here we try to predict the Age of Abalone based on its physical parameters
